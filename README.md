# Pharmaceutical_Analysis_Matplotlib

For this project, we were given pharmaceutical data for anti-cancer drugs that had been tested on 249 mice over 45 days. 
The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.
To do this, I imported the data into Pandas and create a script to analyze the data further. This included cleaning the data, creating data frames, 
and creatign graphs to visualize trends and correlation. 

When reviewing the drug data of four specific regimens, Capomulin and Ramicane seemed to have better outcomes. The final tumor volume for mice using those drugs was much lower than for the other two regimens, Infubinol and Ceftamin. Lastly, I looked at the correlation between weight and tumor volume for the individual drug, Capomulin. Weight appears to have a large impact on effectiveness for that drug. Mice that weighed more did not see their average tumor size drop near as much as mice who weighed less. This seems to suggest that they may want to looking into a larger dosage of the regimen for mice at certain weights.
